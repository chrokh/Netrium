-- * Calendar types

-- | A calendar is a set of days.
--
-- For example a working days calendar is a set of working days. This lets
-- us do date calculations that are sensitive to holidays etc.
--
-- We can also define or calculate calendars for special purposes, like
-- all the delivery days in a contract delivery schedule.
--
-- Note that calendars are not contigious sets of days, that is they are not
-- date ranges, they usually do contain gaps. Calendars are finite, that is
-- there is a first and a last day that are listed in the calendar.
--
data Calendar = Calendar !String             -- calendar name (for error messages)
                         !(UArray Day Bool)  -- bitmap of day -> workday
                                             -- very compact: 46 bytes per year

-- In future we might want infinte calendars to allow for weekday or weekend,
-- or monthly calendars. These would be useful in calculations, if not directly
-- on their own. But then these would not be suitable for use as delivery
-- schedules. We might need to distinguish finite range calendars. Or just make
-- it a runtime error.
